##Abstract:

As part of this project, we designed and built a Blood Donation platform called “Gift of 
Blood”. The objective is to implement a general computerized solution which not only helps patients 
in need of blood to have blood donations easily, but also strengthens social ties and partially solves 
the problem of blood shortage experienced by donation centers in Morocco.



To do this, we first started by doing a summary market study to identify the user need in the 
national context. This study was followed by the design and development of a website.




The design of this project was carried out using UML as a modeling language and agile 
methods for the conduct of the project. Then, we treated the development of the applications mainly 
thanks to web languages, structured around the MVC model, hence the use of the Laravel 
Framework. Concerning the management of the database, we opted for the Mysql DBMS
